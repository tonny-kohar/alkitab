/**
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This is Netbeans Platform RCP specific API implementation
 * 
 * It is just simple Node wrapper for BookViewer. Anything is handled by {@link BookViewer} <br>
 * Alternative architecture is this BookViewerNode handle JSword Book rather than BookViewer.
 * The drawback is the API will be very tight with Netbeans Platform RCP, but more integrated into
 * Netbeans Platform.
 * 
 * So which one to choose ? Currently it is using the first approach.
